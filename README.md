# 📅 jQuery DatePicker Event Filter

An interactive event calendar using jQuery UI's `DatePicker`. Users can select a date and dynamically filter a list of events by **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** — all displayed inline without page reloads.
This project demonstrates dynamic DOM filtering, date-based logic, and smooth integration between jQuery UI widgets and custom event data.
